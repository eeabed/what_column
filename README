What Column
==========

Tired of having to look at the schema.rb to figure out what columns belong to a model?  
Well no more!

With what_column a little comment appears at the top of your models displaying the column details!

Just simply run the rake command: rake what_column:add - and this is what gets generated:

# === List of columns ===
#   id: integer
#   name: string
#   created_at: datetime
#   updated_at: datetime
# =======================
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
end


Turn it off with rake what_column:remove.
