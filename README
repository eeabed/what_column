What Column?!?
==============

A Rails plugin that adds comments to all of your model files detailing database column details.

==============

Tired of having to look at the schema.rb to figure out what columns belong to a model?  
Well no more!

With the what_column Rails plugin a little comment appears at the top of your models displaying the column details!

INSTALLATION
==========
Go into your Rails folder and type:
script/plugin install git://github.com/thechrisoshow/what_column.git

USAGE
==========
Once what_column is installed everytime you run migrations in development mode your models will get a comment block plonked into all your models that details column information:

# === List of columns ===
#   id: integer
#   name: string
#   created_at: datetime
#   updated_at: datetime
# =======================
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
end


Should you wish to run the commands manually there are rake commands.  Check 'em out:

  rake what_column:add #=> Adds column details to models
  rake what_column:remove #=> Removes column details from models
